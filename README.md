# Arduino IDE 2.x (beta)

[![Arduino IDE](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/workflows/Arduino%20IDE/badge.svg)](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Arduino+IDE%22)

This repository contains the source code of the Arduino IDE 2.x, which is currently in beta stage. If you're looking for the stable IDE, go to the repository of the 1.x version at https://github.com/arduino/Arduino.

The Arduino IDE 2.x is a major rewrite, sharing no code with the IDE 1.x. It is based on the [Theia IDE](https://theia-ide.org/) framework and built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). The backend operations such as compilation and uploading are offloaded to an [arduino-cli](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli) instance running in daemon mode. This new IDE was developed with the goal of preserving the same interface and user experience of the previous major version in order to provide a frictionless upgrade.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **beta** software. Help us test it!

## Contributions and development

Contributions are very welcome! You can browse the list of open issues to see what's needed and then you can submit your code using a Pull Request. Please provide detailed descriptions. We also appreciate any help in testing issues and patches contributed by other users.

This repository contains the main code, but two more repositories are included during the build process:

* [vscode-arduino-tools](https://github.com/arduino/vscode-arduino-tools): provides support for the language server and the debugger
* [arduino-language-server](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-language-server): provides the language server that parses Arduino code

See the [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for a technical overview of the application and instructions for building the code.
